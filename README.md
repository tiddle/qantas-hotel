## Running Tests
1. Install dependencies (npm install)
2. Run the tests (npm run test)

## Notes
- Tests are incomplete, just ran out of time
    - Needs page tests
    - Needs mocking of calls
    - Generally needs tests that take up a lot of dev time if you're doing it from scratch, due to research, mocking, weird test requirments
- Styles
    - Styles are incomplete due, tried to demonstrate most of the different css skills required
    - Would have done the "rating" system with an icon library and a loop
- Price sorting 
    - Decided to do it server side as it made the most amount of sense, you probably won't have ALL hotels on page at once so server side made more sense
    - Set an initial sort, but probably isn't ideal
    - Probably a more elegant way to do it, but again, the time constraints
- Code organisation
    - Could have code placed in better places, but it's good enough for the scope of the project
